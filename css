Directional means that the beam is well collimated (very parallel) and travels overr
long distances with very little spread.
➢ In conventional light sources (lamp, sodium lamp and torchlight), photons will
travel in random direction. Therefore, these light sources emit light in all directions
and is highly divergent.
➢ On the other hand, in laser, all photons will travel in same direction. Therefore, laser
emits light only in one direction. This is called directionality of laser light. The width
of a laser beam is extremely narrow. Hence, a laser beam can travel to long
distances without spreading.
