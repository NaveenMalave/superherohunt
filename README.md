#Intensity
➢ The intensity of a light is defined as the energy or light per unit time flowing through
a unit normal area.
➢ In anordinary light spreads in all directions; the intensity reaching the target is very
less. But in the case of laser, due to high directionality many beams of light
incident in small area, therefore the intensity of light high.
