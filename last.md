Spontaneous emission of radiation
Normally the atom in the excited state will not stay there, for a long time i.e., it can stay
up to 10-9 second. This called life time of atom. After the life time of the excited atom it
returns to the ground state by emitting photon energy E= E2-E1 = hùë¢, spontaneously
without any external energy as shown in Fig.2.5.
This process is known as Spontaneous emission of radiation
