Stimulated emission of radiation:
Suppose if we incident some suitable form of energy on the atom in the excited state,
then it can also return to the ground by emitting a photon, known as stimulated emission.
In this process two photons are released. They have same frequency, wavelength and in
phase difference and of same directionality as shown in Fig.2.6
